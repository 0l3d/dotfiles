## 📦 Package Installation

<<<<<<< HEAD
✨ All required packages are listed in:  
`SYSTEM/pkgs`

- 🐊 **Gentoo Users:**  
  Add my repo and install everything using `emerge`.

- 🛠️ **Other Distributions:**  
  You will need to manually install the packages listed.
=======
Instead of listing individual packages, I have compiled them in the following location where you can find all the necessary packages:
0l3d.system/world

- If you're using **Gentoo**, add my repositories and use `emerge` to install all the packages.
- If you’re using another distribution, you’ll need to manually install each package listed.
