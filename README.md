## üì¶ Package Installation

Instead of listing individual packages, I have compiled them in the following location where you can find all the necessary packages:
0l3d.system/world

- If you're using **Gentoo**, add my repositories and use `emerge` to install all the packages.
- If you‚Äôre using another distribution, you‚Äôll need to manually install each package listed.

---

## üöÄ Installation

To clone and set up the dotfiles configuration, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0l3d/dotfiles.git ~/.0l3d.Dotfiles
~/.0l3d.Dotfiles/configure
```
Make sure you have git and bash installed before running the script.
